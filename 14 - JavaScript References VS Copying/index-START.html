    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        social: {
            twitter: "@neeraj15022001"
        }
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    // console.log(person, cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //Copy one level down for whole copying reference use clone deep
    const cap3 = {...person}
    cap3.number = 100
    cap3.age = 500
    cap3.social.twitter = "@dummy"
    console.log(person, cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //Cheat way is using JSON.parse
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    dev2.social.twitter = "@test"
    console.log(person, dev2)
